#Give your thoughts on TDD

##What was positive and good about using TDD?
TDD helps preventing errors when a developer starts by treating edge cases and has to put thought into how to handle said edge cases.

<br>
First you write a test -> test must fail -> you implement required function -> write edge test cases -> implement code to handle them

## what was annoying or difficult?
implementing certain tests over and over again seems repetitive when you can memorize certain pitfals that you learn to avoid
when using tests over a longer period
<br>
## what suprised you?
thinking of max and min numbers in java such as for ints and doubles and how these inputs potentially should be handled. i generally
learned a bit from the testing on how to handle generic malicious input cases. 

## did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnt otherwise have thought of
yes a bit

 
## Reflections
reasons the man might not die: the shot did not hit the man, the shot did not critically damage the man,
the man did not die yet but will die soon due to the damage

## Alien
hold the toothpast with your left hand -> hold brush with right hand -> apply paste on the brush ->
move brush to mouth -> move brush with right hand in circular waves inside mouth
